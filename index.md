## Past Events


### 2023.09.06 - [RustTLV @ Final - September Edition](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/events/295441355/)

Hosted and sponsored by [Final](https://www.final.co.il/)

* [Gabor Szabo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/) - What I learned from learning Rust
The journey of a veteran programmer from 0 to the first published Crate and beyond.

[Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/) has been programming for almost 40 years and has been teaching programming for more than 20. He taught a lot of people how to use Perl and then a lot more people how to use Python. His hope is that soon he will be teaching people how to write Rust.

* [Efi Merdler Kravitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efime/) - Rustifying Serverless

Rust, known for its performance and security, offers significant advantages when used with AWS Lambda. This session delves into deploying Rust functions using AWS SAM and cargo-lambda, enabling streamlined development right from one's own computer. Attendees will learn strategies to expedite local builds for Lambda deployments, with a spotlight on tools like mold and sccache. Dive into how Rust can enhance Lambda functions, from developing Lambda extensions to seamlessly integrating Rust into existing Python and Node.js Lambda code without necessitating a complete overhaul. Also, gain insights on methods for reducing binary sizes using Rust.

Efi is the Head of engineering @ [Cloudex](https://www.cloudex.pro/), AWS Serverless Hero amd author of [Learning Serverless in Hebrew](https://headstart.co.il/project/70568).

### 2022.12.29 - [December Edition - xtask, macros and low level features](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/events/290156141/)

Just before the new year celebrations, Rust TLV is back at it with another event, this time hosted by [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.com/) and [Spectral](https://spectralops.io/)! We have multiple great technical talks this time, including tooling, language features and great debug stories.

* Using xtask & xtaskops by [Dotan Nahum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondot/)
Dotan is the CEO and Co-Founder @ Spectral, a Check Point company focused on developer-first security.

* Procedural Macros Intro + Tips by [Dan Aloni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aloni/)
Developing Procedural Macros is a significant resource in the arsenal of advanced Rust programming. I'll talk about procedural macros and share some methods and tips about how to develop them more easily.

Dan Aloni (@DanAloni) is a systems software developer who specializes in Linux kernel, storage systems, compilation, virtualization, open source software, packaging, and build systems. He is the author of the [coLinux project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Linux) and has contributed code to various open-source projects, including the Rust compiler and the Linux kernel. Dan is currently an independent contractor.

* Going Low with Rust by [Aviram Hassan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aviram-hassan/)
Technical walkthrough of implementing low level functionality using Rust - hooking Go functions, writing assembly, unsafe functions, naked functions, full-clothed functions
